172,"Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; ",
174,"But further way found none, ",
174,"so thick entwined, As one continued brake, the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed All path of man or beast that passed that way. ",
178,"One gate there only was, and that looked east On the other side: ",
179,"which when the arch-felon saw, Due entrance he disdained; ",
180,"and, in contempt, At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet. ",
183,"As when a prowling wolf, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, ",
185,"Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, ",
187,Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold: ,
188,"Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash Of some rich burgher, ",
189,"whose substantial doors, Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault, ",
191,"In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles: ",
192,So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold; ,
193,So since into his church lewd hirelings climb. ,
194,"Thence up he flew, ",
194,"and on the tree of life, The middle tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a cormorant; ",
196,"yet not true life Thereby regained, but sat devising death To them who lived; ",
198,"nor on the virtue thought Of that life-giving plant, ",
199,"but only used For prospect, what well used had been the pledge Of immortality. ",
201,"So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, ",
203,"but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to their meanest use. ",
205,"Beneath him with new wonder now he views, To all delight of human sense exposed, In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more, A Heaven on Earth: ",h
208,"For blissful Paradise Of God the garden was, by him in the east Of Eden planted; ",h
210,"Eden stretched her line From Auran eastward to the royal towers Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings, ","g,h"
213,Or where the sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar: ,"a,g,h"
214,In this pleasant soil His far more pleasant garden God ordained; ,"a,g,h"
216,"Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; ","c,h"
218,"And all amid them stood the tree of life, High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit Of vegetable gold; ","d,h"
220,"and next to life, Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by, Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. ","d,h"
223,"Southward through Eden went a river large, ","b,h"
224,"Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill Passed underneath ingulfed; ","b,h"

227,"which, through veins Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn, Rose a fresh fountain, ","e,h"
229,and with many a rill Watered the garden; ,"d,e,h"
230,"thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood, ","b,d,h"
232,"Which from his darksome passage now appears, ","b,h"
233,"And now, divided into four main streams, ","f,h"
234,"Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm And country, whereof here needs no account; ","f,h"
236,"But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, ",h
237,"How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks, Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold, ","d,f,h"
239,"With mazy errour under pendant shades Ran nectar, visiting each plant, ","d,f,h"
240,"and fed Flowers worthy of Paradise, ","d,f,h"
241,"which not nice Art In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain, ","d,f,h"
244,"Both where the morning sun first warmly smote The open field, ","h,j"

Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
{S:Satan} {V:had journeyed on}, pensive and slow;\n
But further way {S:{i:Satan}}{V:found} {O:none}, \nso thick entwined,
As one continued brake, {S:the undergrowth
Of shrubs and tangling bushes} {V:had perplexed}
{O:All path of man or beast that passed that way}.\n
{O:One gate} {S:there} {V:only was}, and {S:that} {V:looked} {O:east}
On the other side:\n {2:which when {S:the arch-felon} {V:saw}},
{O:Due entrance} {S:he} {V:disdained};\n and, in contempt,
At one flight {O:bound high} {V:over-leaped} {O:all bound
Of hill or highest wall}, and sheer within
Lights on his feet.\n As when {S:a prowling wolf},
Whom {O:hunger} {V:drives} to seek new haunt for prey,\n
{S:{i:a prowling wolf}}{V:Watching} {O:where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,}\n
{S:{i:a prowling wolf}}{V:Leaps} o'er the fence with ease into the fold:\n
Or as {S:a thief}, {V:bent to unhoard} {O:the cash
Of some rich burgher},\n {S:whose substantial doors,
Cross-barred and bolted fast}, {V:fear} {O:no assault},\n
{S:{i:a thief}}{V:In} at the window {V:climbs}, or o'er the tiles:\n
So {V:clomb} {S:this first grand thief} {V:into} {O:God's fold};\n
So since {O:into his church} {S:lewd hirelings} {V:climb}.\n
Thence {V:up} {S:he} {V:flew},\n and {S:{i:this first grand thief}}{O:on the tree of life,
The middle tree and highest there that grew},
{V:Sat} like a cormorant;\n {S:{i:this first grand thief}}yet not true {O:life}
Thereby {V:regained}, {2:but {S:{i:this first grand thief}}{V2:sat} devising death
To them who lived};\n {S:{i:this first grand thief}}nor on the virtue {V:thought
Of} {O:that life-giving plant},\n {S:{i:this first grand thief}}but only {V:used
For} {O:prospect}, {2:{S2:what well used} {V2:had been} {O2:the pledge
Of immortality}}.\n So {S:little} {V:knows}
{O:Any}, {S:but God alone}, to value right
The good before him,\n but {S:{i:little}}{V:perverts} {O:best things
To worst abuse, or to their meanest use}.\n
Beneath him with new wonder now {S:he} {V:views},
{2:{O2:To all delight of human sense} {V2:exposed}},
In narrow room, {O:Nature's whole wealth, yea more,
A Heaven on Earth}:\n For {O:blissful Paradise
Of God} {S:the garden} {V:was}, {2:by him in the east
Of Eden {V2:planted}};\n {S:Eden} {V:stretched} {O:her line}
From Auran eastward to the royal towers
Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,\n
Or where {S:the sons of Eden} long before
{V:Dwelt in} {O:Telassar}:\n In this pleasant soil
{O:His far more pleasant garden} {S:God} {V:ordained};\n
Out of the fertile ground {S:he} {V:caused to grow}
{O:All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste};\n
And {S:all} amid them {V:stood} {O:the tree of life,
High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit
Of vegetable gold};\n and next to life,
{S:Our death, the tree of knowledge}, {V:grew} fast by,
{S:Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill}.\n
{O:Southward} through Eden {V:went} {S:a river large},\n
{S:{i:a river large}}{V:Nor changed} {O:his course}, but {2:{S2:{i:a river large}}through the shaggy hill
{V2:Passed underneath} ingulfed};\n for {S:God} {V:had thrown}
{O:That mountain} {2:as {S2:{i:God}{O2:his garden-mould high} {V2:raised}
Upon the rapid current},\n which, through veins
Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,
{V:Rose} {S:a fresh fountain},\n and {S:{i:a fresh fountain}}with many a rill
{V:Watered} {O:the garden};\n thence {S:{i:a fresh fountain}}{V:united fell
Down} {O:the steep glade}, {2:and {S2:{i:a fresh fountain}}{V2:met} {O2:the nether flood}},\n
Which {S:{i:a fresh fountain}}{O:from his darksome passage} now {V:appears},\n
And now, {S:{i:a fresh fountain}}{V:divided into} {O:four main streams},\n
{S:{i:a fresh fountain}}{V:Runs} {O:diverse}, {2:{V2:wandering} {O2:many a famous realm
And country, whereof here needs no account}};\n
But rather {V:{i:needs}}{O:to tell how}, {2:if {S:Art} {V:could tell}},\n
How {S:from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks},
{V:Rolling on} {O:orient pearl and sands of gold},\n
{S:{i:from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks}}With mazy errour under pendant shades
{V:Ran} nectar, {2:{V2:visiting} {O2:each plant},\n and {S:{i:from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks}}{V:fed}
{O:Flowers worthy of Paradise},\n {2:which {S2:{i:Flowers worthy of Paradise}}{V2:not} {O2:nice Art
In beds and curious knots}}, but {S:Nature boon}
{V:Poured forth} {O:{i:Flowers worthy of Paradise}}profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,\n
Both where {S:the morning sun} {V:first warmly smote}
{O:The open field},\n and where {S:the unpierced shade}
{V:Imbrowned} {O:the noontide bowers}:\n Thus {V:was} {S:this place}
{O:A happy rural seat of various view};\n
{S:Groves} whose {2:{S2:rich trees} {V2:wept} {O2:odorous gums and balm}},\n
{S:Others} whose {2:{S2:fruit, burnished with golden rind},
{V2:Hung} {O2:amiable}\n, {S:Hesperian fables} {V:{i:are}}{O:true},\n
{2:If {O:true}}, {S:here} {V:{i:is}}{O:only, and of delicious taste}:\n
Betwixt them {S:lawns, or level downs, and flocks
Grazing the tender herb}, {V:were interposed},
{S:Or palmy hillock};\n or {S:the flowery lap
Of some irriguous valley} {V:spread} {O:her store,
Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose}:\n
Another side, {S:umbrageous grots and caves
Of cool recess}{V:{i:are}},\n o'er which {S:the mantling vine}
{V:Lays forth} {O:her purple grape},\n and {S:{i:the mantling vine}}{V:gently creeps}
Luxuriant;\n mean while {S:murmuring waters} {V:fall}
{O:Down the slope hills}, {2:{V:dispersed}},\n or in a lake,
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
{S:{i:a lake}}{O:Her crystal mirrour} {V:holds},\n {S:{i:murmuring waters}}{V:unite} {O:their streams}.\n
{S:The birds} {O:their quire} {V:apply};\n {S:airs, vernal airs},
Breathing the smell of field and grove, {V:attune}
{O:The trembling leaves},\n while {S:universal Pan},
{2:{V2:Knit with} {O2:the Graces and the Hours} in dance},
{V:Led on} {O:the eternal Spring}.\n {S:{i:it}}{V:Not} {O:that fair field
Of Enna},\n where {S:Proserpine gathering flowers,
Herself a fairer flower} {O:by gloomy Dis}
{V:Was gathered},\n which {V:cost} {S:Ceres} {O:all that pain
To seek her through the world};\n {V:nor} {S:that sweet grove
Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired
Castalian spring}, {V:might} {O:with this Paradise
Of Eden} {V:strive};\n {V:nor} {S:that Nyseian isle
Girt with the river Triton}, {2:where {S2:old Cham,
Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove},
{V2:Hid} {O2:Amalthea, and her florid son
Young Bacchus}, from his stepdame Rhea's eye};\n
{V:Nor} {2:where {S2:Abassin kings} {O2:their issue} {V2:guard}},
{S:Mount Amara},\n though {S:this} by some {V:supposed}
{O:True Paradise} under the Ethiop line
By Nilus' head,\n {S:{i:Mount Amara}}{V:enclosed with} {O:shining rock},
{2:{S:{i:shining rock}}{V:{i:is}}{O2:A whole day's journey high, but wide remote
From this Assyrian garden}},\n where {S:the Fiend}
{V:Saw}, undelighted, {O:all delight, all kind
Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange}\n
